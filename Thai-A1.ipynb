    "We've studied two types of search algorithms during the recent lectures: Uninformed Search and Informed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uninformed Search (aka blind search) refers to the search strategies that do not use additional information about states and goal of the search - nothing beyond the provided problem definition. The first algorithms that we studied from Chapter 3 of the Russel & Norvig textbook were Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) which both fall into the category of Uniformed Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also studied how we can modify DFS to combine the advantages of BFS (completeness and conditional optimality) with the main advantage of DFS --space complexity of $O(bm)$ where $b$ is the branching factor and $m$ is the maximum depth of the search space. Limited Depth Search and Iterative Deepening DFS were two algorithms that we studied in that section and you are going to use them in Part I of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, you are going to practice Informed Search algorithms and heuristic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Part III, you will work on an example graph by applying A* and checking whether the provided heuristic is admissible and consistent or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pedagogically, this assignment will help you:\n",
    "- better understand how search algorithms are implemented and work in practice. \n",
    "- practice reading documentation. This is a very important skill in AI/ML/Data Science collaborative environments and teams."

    "No e7 could not be defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 8 puzzle problem there is a concept of inversions, inversions being when a piece in the state is larger than a piece that follows it. The states of the 8-puzzle problem can be catagorized into two disjoined sets, one set containing states that have a even number of inversions, and the other containing states with an odd number of inversions. Its said that no matter what moves are done to the board, states with even number of inversions will remain even. and odd states will remain odd. So if the inital state of the problem had an odd number of inversions and the goal state has an even number then there is no way for the inital state to reach the goal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem e7 has an odd number of inversions, while the goal state has an even number of inversions. Therefore the code determined that the e7 problem was unsolvable and did not bother trying to solve it. The reason for the inversions staying even or staying odd is because if you do a row move, the inversion count will not change, and if you do a column move the inversion count will change by 2 meaning even numbers will say even and odd will stay odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q5: \n",
    "\n",
    "The best heuristic among the four tested is the astar_manhattan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason being is that for any node, the h2 manhattan heuristic is always greater than or equal to the h1 misplaced tiles heuristic. This is considered to be Domination, in that h2 dominates h1, and A* using h2 will never expand more nodes than A* using h1. This is because every node that has f(n) < the cost of the optimal solution path, will be surely expanded when the heuristic is consistent. And since h2 is greater than or equal to h1, every node that is surely expanded by h2 is also in the set expanded by h1. but with h1 being a more of an under estimate it may cause more nodes to be expanded than h2 would. And thus being less efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the report that that all the heuristics found the cost optimal solution returning a cost of 15. But the number of nodes that the misplaced tiles and square root heuristic expanded is much higher that the manhattan heuristic. This is due to the misplaced tiles and the square root heuristic being smaller then the manatan heuristic, causeing it to under estimate more and expand more nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The astar_max heuristic managed to do just as well as the manhatan heuristic but thats only because it took the max between the manhatan and the misplaced tile heuristic. And we know that the manhatan heuristic will always be greater than the misplaced tile heuristic. So there is no point in using that, when you can directly use the manhatan heuristic. There for the manhatan heuristic is the best one among the 4 heuristics.      "
